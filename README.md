The website is also fully responsive! Check it out on mobile -- it should work fine (albeit doesn't look as good as PC). Building this was great since it helped me improve my CSS and responsive design skills and I learned a lot of CSS skills like keyframes, transitions, transform, animations, media queries, web accessibility, responsive design, etc.
