                <p className="about-description">
                    Hi there! I'm Pranav, a rising junior in highschool based out of Richmond, Virginia. Ever since
                    I was a kid, I have always been fascinated with how diverse the web was -- and that passion has 
                    led me to pursue web development.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    I <span className="tc">love</span> web development since it allows me to express my creativity in 
                    limitless ways, transforming abstract ideas into visually stunning and interactive digital experiences 
                    that captivate and engage others!
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Outside of web development, you can find me playing volleyball, going on long runs, and hanging out 
                    with my friends!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The picture of me has been removed btw since I almost got doxxed with my old one ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
